# NClassDotNetCore

This is an attempt to port [NClass v2.4](http://nclass.sourceforge.net/index.html) by Balazs Tihanyi to .NET Core.

Although .NET Core is a cross-platform framework, NClass is based on WinForms technology. Unfortunately at the moment, .NET Core/WinForms is only supported on the Windows operating system.

# Overview

NClass is a free tool to easily create UML class diagrams with full C# and Java language support. The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly for easy and fast development. Properties, enums, delegates and other language specific elements are fully supported with strict syntactical and semantical verification.

Design your application with just a few clicks - the main goal is to provide a simple but powerful class designer that is very intuitive to use. Diagram styles help you to create professional looking diagrams, just like in Visual Studio or other commercial products. Furthermore, you can generate code from your models or you can also import classes from existing .NET assemblies.
Please note, NClass is far from complete. There are many missing features that are planned for future versions. But if you have an idea, please share your thoughts in one of the way listed on the [support](http://nclass.sourceforge.net/support.html) page.
